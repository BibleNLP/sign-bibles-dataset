Sources:
* eng-engbsb.txt is from the ebible Corpus, found at https://github.com/BibleNLP/ebible
* usfm_book_identifiers I made based on https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html
* vref.txt is also copied from the eBible corpus, but I EDITED it so that Daniel 5:31 would replaces Daniel 6:1, because the Chronological Bible in American Sign Languge used Daniel 5:31.
